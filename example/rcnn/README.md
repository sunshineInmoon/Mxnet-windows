# Faster R-CNN in MXNet with distributed implementation and data parallelization

Region Proposal Network solves object detection as a regression problem
from the objectness perspective. Bounding boxes are predicted by applying
learned bounding box deltas to base boxes, namely anchor boxes across
different positions in feature maps. Training process directly learns a
mapping from raw image intensities to bounding box transformation targets.

Fast R-CNN treats general object detection as a classification problem and
bounding box prediction as a regression problem. Classifying cropped region
feature maps and predicting bounding box displacements together yields
detection results. Cropping feature maps instead of image input accelerates
computation utilizing shared convolution maps. Bounding box displacements
are simultaneously learned in the training process.

Faster R-CNN utilize an alternate optimization training process between RPN
and Fast R-CNN. Fast R-CNN weights are used to initiate RPN for training.

## Getting Started
* Install python package `easydict`, `cv2`, `matplotlib`. MXNet require `numpy`.
* Install MXNet with version no later than Commit 8a3424e, preferably the latest master.
  Follow the instructions at http://mxnet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/how_to/build.html. Install the python interface.
* Try out detection result by running `python demo.py --prefix final --epoch 0 --image myimage.jpg --gpu 0`.
  Suppose you have downloaded pretrained network and place the extracted file `final-0000.params` in this folder and there is an image named `myimage.jpg`.

## Training and Testing Faster R-CNN
* Install additional python package `scipy`.
* Download Pascal VOC data and place them to `data` folder according to `Data Folder Structure`.
  You might want to create a symbolic link to VOCdevkit folder by `ln -s /path/to/your/VOCdevkit data/VOCdevkit`.
* Download VGG16 pretrained model, use `mxnet/tools/caffe_converter` to convert it,
  rename to `vgg16-symbol.json` and `vgg16-0001.params` and place it in `model` folder.
  `model` folder will be used to place model checkpoints along the training process.
* Start training by running `python train_alternate.py` after VOCdevkit is ready.
  A typical command would be `python train_alternate.py --gpus 0`. This will train the network on the VOC07 trainval.
  More control of training process can be found in the argparse help accessed by `python train_alternate.py -h`.
* Start testing by run `python test.py` after completing the training process.
  A typical command would be `python test.py --has_rpn --prefix model/final --epoch 8`. This will test the network on the VOC07 test.
  Adding a `--vis` will turn on visualization and `-h` will show help as in the training process.

## Training and Testing Fast R-CNN
* Download Pascal VOC data and place them to `data` folder according to `Data Folder Structure`.
  You might want to create a symbolic link to VOCdevkit folder by `ln -s /path/to/your/VOCdevkit data/VOCdevkit`.
* Download precomputed selective search data and place them to `data` folder according to `Data Folder Structure`.
* Download VGG16 pretrained model, use `mxnet/tools/caffe_converter` to convert it,
  rename to `vgg16-symbol.json` and `vgg16-0001.params` and place it in `model` folder.
  `model` folder will be used to place model checkpoints along the training process.
* Start training by running `python -m tools.train_rcnn --proposal ss` to use the selective search proposal.
* Start testing by running `python -m tools.test_rcnn --proposal ss`.

## Approximate Joint Training
* Support training faster-rcnn model using end2end training method which is implemented by approximate joint training, and it is almost the same as [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn)
* Start end2end training by running `python -u train_end2end.py`, please using `python train_end2end.py --help` to query how to setting the training paramters, such as you can setting the step of dropping lr by `--factor-step`.
