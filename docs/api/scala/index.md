MXNet - Scala API
=================
MXNet supports Scala programming language. The MXNet Scala package brings flexible and efficient GPU
computing and state-of-art deep learning to Scala.

- It enables you to write seamless tensor/matrix computation with multiple GPUs in Scala.
- It also enables you construct and customize the state-of-art deep learning models in Scala,
  and apply them to tasks such as image classification and data science challenges.

We are working on MXNet for Scala API interface documentation. Stay tuned! In the mean time you can refer below resources to get started.
