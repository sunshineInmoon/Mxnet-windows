# MXNet - Python API

## Introduction
MXNet supports Python programming language. The MXNet Python package brings flexible and efficient GPU
computing and state-of-art deep learning to Python.

- It enables you to write seamless tensor/matrix computation with multiple GPUs in Python.
- It also enables you construct and customize the state-of-art deep learning models in Python,
  and apply them to tasks such as image classification and data science challenges.


## Python API Reference
* [Module API](module.md) a flexible high-level interface for training neural networks
