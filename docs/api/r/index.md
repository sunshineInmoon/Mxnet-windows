MXNet - R API
=============
MXNet supports R programming language. The MXNet R package brings flexible and efficient GPU
computing and state-of-art deep learning to R.

- It enables you to write seamless tensor/matrix computation with multiple GPUs in R.
- It also enables you construct and customize the state-of-art deep learning models in R,
  and apply them to tasks such as image classification and data science challenges.

We are working on MXNet for R API interface documentation. In the mean time you can refer below resources to get started.
